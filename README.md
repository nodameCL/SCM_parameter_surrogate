## training data 
The data used to train different models are available for download from: https://zenodo.org/record/7818931. 

- Random forest and simple DNN share the same data format. training, validation and test data set are stored as train.pkl, val.pkl, and test.pkl, respectively. 
- The data used to train complex DNN are stored in NPZ format, which are train_combined.npz, val_combined.npz and test_combined.npz 

## experimental test data 

The tested experiment data are located at datasets/exp folder
